I am a PhD candidate in cancer research, focusing on multi-omics studies to explore the mechanisms of metastasis and recurrence in cancer, particularly liver cancer. In my research, I integrate genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to comprehensively understand the biological characteristics of liver cancer cells during the metastatic process. This interdisciplinary approach not only provides new insights into the complex biological mechanisms of liver cancer but also aids in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. I am dedicated to using data-driven methods to explore novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to address the challenges posed by liver cancer and related tumors.

My research interests include cancer multiomics studies, cancer metastasis and recurrence, and cancer evolution. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LG9ooTYAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LG9ooTYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
