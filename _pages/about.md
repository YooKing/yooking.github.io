I am a PhD candidate in cancer research, focusing on multi-omics studies to explore the mechanisms of metastasis and recurrence in cancer, particularly liver cancer. In my research, I integrate genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to comprehensively understand the biological characteristics of liver cancer cells during the metastatic process. This interdisciplinary approach not only provides new insights into the complex biological mechanisms of liver cancer but also aids in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. I am dedicated to using data-driven methods to explore novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to address the challenges posed by liver cancer and related tumors.

## Research Interests
- Mechanisms of Cancer Metastasis and Recurrence: Investigating the molecular and cellular processes driving cancer metastasis and recurrence, with a focus on liver cancer, to identify potential therapeutic targets.

- Multi-Omics Data Integration: Utilizing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics approaches to develop a comprehensive understanding of tumor biology and its clinical implications.

- Biomarker Discovery and Targeted Therapy: Identifying novel biomarkers for early detection, prognosis, and the development of personalized, targeted treatment strategies for liver cancer and other malignancies.
