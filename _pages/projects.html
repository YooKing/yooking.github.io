<h2>&#127775; DL-based AEM data analysis system</h2>
<p, align = "justify">
During my PhD and first postdoctoral program, I focused on developing a comprehensive analysis system for airborne electromagnetic data (AEM) based on deep learning (DL)
  techniques. The system consists of key processes, including denoising, simulation, resistivity imaging and uncertainty analysis. 
  The overall goal is investigating underground structures with higher depth resolution and efficiency.

    <p, align = "justify; margin-bottom: 5px;">The late-time time-domain EM (TEM) responses are often dominated by complex noises, including environmental noise, systematic erros, industrial power disturbance,
       and sferics. We developed a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with the autoencoder structure to improve the quality of TEM signals
      at later times, thus enabling us to better resolve deeper structures.</p>
